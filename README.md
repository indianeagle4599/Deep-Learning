# Deep Learning Labs

These are some experiments we performed in our Deep Learning Labs.
They have greatly helped me internalise the concepts of Deep Learning.
I hope these experiments help anyone who wants to travel the path of Deep Learning just like me.
Each new lab experiment holds a new concept, thought or implementation method.
Going through with all of them can be very useful.

## Some information about this repository

1. Some of the experiments are accompanied by a PDF document and its corresponding *LATEX* document.
2. If someone is interested in research work, these documents may help understand the basics of writing papers in *LATEX*.
3. If the documentation in any code is less, the document along with it may be able to provide more information.
4. Most of the implementations follow one or more online sources (like blogs). So, this repository is just a concentration of them.
5. Some implementations have been made on Jupyter Notebooks and some on Google Colaboratory. Setting both up can be useful.
6. The internal READMEs say where it is better to run a particular notebook. If you would like to run the notebook elsewhere, you must make relevant changes so that errors can be avoided.

## About the experiments

* **Lab 1** - Basic things one can or may need to do to create DL models.
* **Lab 2** - Creating our own Neural Network (from scratch).
* **Lab 3** - Making and tuning a Neural Network model on our own dataset.
