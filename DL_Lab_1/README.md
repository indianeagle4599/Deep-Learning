# Deep Learning Lab 1

One of the first and most important thing while learning ML or DL is being familiar with the environment.
The best way to do so is by learning the different things one needs to do and how they can be done.
Below, we have a set of tasks. Upon completion, we would be one step closer to being better at Deep Learning.

Google colaboratory is one of the best Interactive Python Notebook interfaces out there.
One of the best part about it is the cloud computation. When we use Colab, we are using resources provided by them.
Also, we can create the environment the way we need it without having to use up our local memory.

One of the disadvantages is that the speed and computation time is limited.
So, it is best for practise and experimentation but we may need to look elsewhere if we need more.

## Tasks:

### Loading Datasets

There are many different ways to load data into our notebook:

* *Load the data from Google Drive.*
* *Show that you can get data using Kaggle API.*
* *Mount the drive and load local data.*

Each of them have their own advantages and disadvantages. In some cases, only one of the ways can work. So, knowing them all can be very  useful.

### Google Drive features and functionalities

Google colaboratory provides many features and functions which can be useful:

* *Install libraries using pip.*
* *Run a Neural Network on MNIST dataset.*
* *Show results using CPU, GPU and TPU configurations.*

This notebook shows the usage of all of these but it may not be clear. Make sure to search online for details on how to do these.

### Neural Networks Practice

Since our end goal is to learn how to implement and use Neural Networks, creating a basic model is important. So, the final task is - *Create a Neural network to run on your dataset.*
