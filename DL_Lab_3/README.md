# Deep Learning Lab 3

*Better to run on Colab*

Having seen how the environment works and how Neural Networks work, now we go on to make a real model.
We can now go on and see what we really do when we make Deep Learning models.

Do make sure that you have your own dataset for this experiment because the one used in this notebook cannot be found online.
All you need to do is make sure you have numbers and a prediction class. 

For example, you can use [Prostate Cancer Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/sajidsaifi/prostate-cancer) dataset. Just make sure to pass the correct column into "y" to avoid confusion.

If you were able to successfully complete Lab 1, then you can use the same method you used there because the first few steps are the same.

## Tasks

* Mount the drive and load your data.
* Create a Neural network to run on your dataset.
* Tune the model for best accuracy.
* Evaluate and show the results of the model for the dataset.

### Note

As is visible, the first two steps are the same. Although, once we make our First Neural Network, we must tune it for better performance.
It is quite rare for us to stumble upon the perfect NN in the first try.

Moreover, it is important to see how it can be improved.
To do so, we vary the values we pass into the NN, we vary the way we make it and try multiple times.
That's how we know we have found one of the better networks.
