# Creating our own Neural Networks

*Can run locally or on Colab*

Learning about Deep Learning, it is important for us to know the intuition and working of a Neural Network.
A book named "Grokking Deep Learning *- Andrew W. Trask*" explains how one may go about making one on their own.
They have provided a great explanation of the code as well so make sure to look at that while going through this implementation.

The implementation is almost identical but the values are different so do keep that in mind.
Also, there may be some differences as well. So, as a challenge, try to identify them if you wish to. ;)

If you are interested in understand the mathematics and how it all works, you can check out the PDF document as well. It may get complex and quickly too. So, do brace yourself.
